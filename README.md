# ECON322
This repo contains all files associated with my research of the effect of the increase of the minimum wage on the food services and drinking places industry in Pennsylvania. The core folder of this repo is the R folder which contains the code of my research that processes data and produces all statistical and graphical output. At this point the code is not particularly user friendly, however, I will be spending time on optimizing and simplifying it, so my research can be easily reproduced.
